# brief-progress-guard.sh — Stop hook (installed by software-factory onboarding)
#
# Deterministically enforces brief documentation: if a brief is active in
# briefs/2-active/ and its file was not modified during this turn, block the
# turn from ending until a Progress Log entry (or routing) happens.
#
# Mechanism: a UserPromptSubmit hook touches .claude/.turn-marker at turn
# start. On Stop, if the active brief's mtime is older than the marker, the
# brief was not touched this turn -> exit 2 (block, stderr fed back to Claude).
# On pass, the marker is re-touched so the next turn is measured freshly.

INPUT=$(cat)

# Never fight the harness: if a previous block already fired this turn, let go.
